                            <p>General practice training is largely an apprenticeship. One of the most effective learning techniques that we have in general practice is the see one, do one, technique that occurs in our shared surgeries. Shared surgeries allow GPs in training to acquire new knowledge and skills, and to give nuance to the way that they communicate with patients, as they learn from an expert. Having said that, there are experts and experts. As an experienced trainer, I myself continue to learn every year, of ways to improve my consulting skills and I have taken the opportunity, whilst organising this teaching program to refine my own skills and to improve the way in which I share decisions with my patients. I've been very fortunate to collaborate with two esteemed colleagues, who have both allowed me to record our teaching sessions. Malcolm Thomas and Dave Tomson both share their insights with us. Malcolm Thomas is the founder member of Effective Professional Interactions. He has held almost every GP Deanery role in the North East but now works full time teaching consultation skills. Dave Tomson is a GP in North Shields. He has a career long interest in the nature of the consultation and in communication skills. He has produced some ground breaking materials to put patients in a more powerful position to make more appropriate shared decisions in health care. These MAGIC materials are available via patient.info/doctor/decision-aids.</p>

Many of the materials that we produce will also be useful to your patients. As busy GPs your time is rationed. Patients’ decisions are becoming increasingly complex. Allowing patients to make informed decisions takes time. It’s important that patients can access materials to help them to make informed decisions, and that that information should be up-to-date and accessible to them. Please feel free to signpost your patients to our materials. These are freely available at realgeneralpractice.co.uk. These patient decision aids are available in multimedia formats and we have recorded audio clips of extended decision option discussions for some of the conditions.</p>

Whilst recording these audios, and whilst teaching our patient decision options workshop, I reminded myself of how time-consuming it is, to go through all the pros and cons that are relevant to any individual patient. These audios are available to patients, to access themselves via realgeneralpractice.co.uk. I would encourage you to signpost patients to these during your consultations.  Then ask them to contact you on the phone to ask for your help to move forward with their decisions.</p>
